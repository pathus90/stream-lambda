Code Kata for learning Java 8 Streams and Lambda
=============

The kata consists of a class called Util and an accompanying JUnit test called UtilTest.

The goal is to implement all the methods in Util, using the Stream and Lambda APIs, so that all the tests in UtilTest goes green.

Repeat until you can implement all the methods blindfolded ;-)
